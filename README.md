# qmk-keymaps

This repo contains keymaps for my Lily58 keyboard, in the format required by [QMK](https://qmk.fm/).

| Folder    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `default` | Contains copies of un-edited keymaps that are shipped with QMK, for reference and as a baseline. |
| `a1v0`    | Contains my standard, everyday keymap. |

## Flashing instructions

First, the keymap needs to be compiled via QMK WSL. Copy the keymap file into the relevant location (e.g. `\\wsl.localhost\QMK\home\qmk\qmk_firmware\keyboards\lily58\keymaps\a1v0`).

Then, in QMK WSL, enter the `qmk_firmware` folder and run this command:

```bash
qmk compile -kb lily58 -km <keymap_name> -e CONVERT_TO=rp2040_ce
```

This creates a `.uf2` file inside the `qmk_firmware` directory.

Unplug the keyboard, separate the two halves (don't **ever** do this when the keyboard is plugged in!), then connect one half to the computer.

In Windows, open **This PC** (aka My Computer) in the file explorer. Press the `RESET` button twice in quick succession on your keyboard half. You should see a new item appear in This PC.

Paste the `.uf2` file into that item and the device will get flashed.

Disconnect and repeat for the other half of the keyboard.

At the end, disconnect, reinstate the TRRS cable between the halves, and connect back to the computer.

## a1v0

This is my default keymap.

### Layers

- (Lower) F-keys and left Windows button
- (Main) QWERTY (all keys do what's written on the keycap)
- (Upper) HJKL

Future functionality/layers, to be added once I gain more experience (intermixed with to-dos):

- consider moving HJKL to the right by on key (i.e. JKL'), to make holding of the layer shift button easier when using the arrows. (This would hopefully also make window snapping easier, but I'm not sure)
- consider adding a key binding for ctrl and shift in the home row on either side, that only activate when you hold one of SDFG or HJKL. This reduces finger movement for shift, and provides and additional ctrl key. Could also be used for alt (would need to set the keys for the HJKL layer, too). This oughtn't affect anything to do with diacritics, because none of the keys I'd use typically get diacritics (though it could impact ÃŸ if I use S)
- number pad (ideally I'd be able to use this with some sort of num-lock key, _and_ with a hold-down layer shift).
- Umlauts and other non-English characters (via [Combos](https://docs.qmk.fm/features/combo))
- right-click, regular click
- Fn-style keys, incl. brightness, volume, play/pause/skip, perhaps on their own layer
- caps lock, num lock
- home, end, pg up/down
- perhaps some sort of dedicated F5 key, since this is a fairly common on and the current F5 combination is not so good
- hash key, backslash, vertical bar, backtick
  - backtick can be some modified version of the apostrophe
  - backlash can be some modified version of the forward slash. Ditto vertical bar?
- improvements to a1v0 logo (it's mostly fine but could perhaps do with a little better image quality)
- find a nice use for other screen (caps lock status, current layer)
- perhaps create shortcuts to display certain things on screen, e.g. different pixel art
- tapdances to lock in certain layers, using, perhaps, double-ESC to revert to main layer
- separate parts of code into separate files for better readability. See: <https://www.reddit.com/r/olkb/comments/1js7ozb/bloated_keymapc/>
- try to downsize ludicrously large QMK installation, since most of it is unnecessary
- check out these [layer ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/qootbl/first_keyboard_with_layers_any_inspiration_for/) for inspiration. Here are some [best practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/rm5ro8/layouts_layers_best_practices_inspirations_etc/)
- just as an experiment, perhaps make a shortcut that converts some key combination into "ServiceNow", which I find awkward to type

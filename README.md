# qmk-keymaps

This repo contains keymaps for my Lily58 keyboard, in the format required by [QMK](https://qmk.fm/).

| Folder | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `default` | Contains copies of un-edited keymaps that are shipped with QMK, for reference and as a baseline. |
| `a1v0` | Contains my standard, everyday keymap. |
